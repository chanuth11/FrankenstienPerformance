Frankenstien Performance in a simple way is to add vibrato to a pianist, not by sound but by feeling to the listener. However, it is more about communicating the intention of each note a pianist plays to have the listener capture the music. It is a tool to help atune (no pun intended) the listener to the musicians performative intentions.
