Frankenstien Performance in a simple way is to add vibrato to a pianist, not by sound but by feeling to the listener.

It a tool to help atune (no pun intended) the listener to the musicians performative intentions. A brief and crude demo can be found from the link: https://photos.app.goo.gl/4rt2y4wctnXFHKrz7 

The overarching idea behind Frankenstien Performance is to wirelessly communicate human thoughtfulness using sensory experiences.
